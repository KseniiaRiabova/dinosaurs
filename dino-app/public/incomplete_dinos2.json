    "description": "Megalosaurus was a large, meat-eating dinosaur. It was one of the first dinosaurs ever found and the first named.When Megalosaurus fossils were first discovered during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, nobody knew what a dinosaur was.From time to time, somebody would find something unusual and not know what to make of it. Items such as a single tooth, part of a leg bone and then a piece of the lower jaw were found, puzzled over and speculated about. All these specimens were discovered around Oxfordshire, England.People found even more mysterious bones in the early 1800s, but it wasn't until around 1818 that William Buckland - a professor from the University of Oxford - began to study the remains in detail.With the help of other scientists including the famous French expert Georges Cuvier, Buckland came to think that the extinct animal might have been a huge lizard that walked on four legs, almost like an oversized iguana. Yet even 200 years ago, he was quick to work out that the animal walked on straight legs, rather than with its legs sprawled out like a lizard.Many years later the first fossils of bipedal dinosaurs were discovered, making it clear that Megalosaurus walked on two legs. A complete Megalosaurus skeleton has yet to be found.In 1824, Megalosaurus was the first dinosaur in history given a name. In fact, it was named before the word 'dinosaur' had even been invented. That didn't happen until 1842, almost twenty years later.Because it was one of the first dinosaurs ever found, many new fossil discoveries over the years have been said to belong to Megalosaurus. At one point, scientists thought there were lots of species of Megalosaurus - more than any other dinosaur.But science has advanced. We can now be much surer about which fossils are Megalosaurus.These days, we think there was only one species - Megalosaurus bucklandii. All the other misnamed fossil specimens have been reassigned to other dinosaurs.Over the years, researchers have given many different size estimates for Megalosaurus.In Victorian times, when nobody knew what the dinosaur really looked like, people thought it might have been 20 metres long. That's huge - almost as long as a tennis court!As more discoveries were made, scientists started to get a better idea of Megalosaurus' true size. Our founder Richard Owen gave a smaller estimate of nine metres long in 1842.Today, experts think it was more likely to have been around six metres long.So even though the name Megalosaurus means 'big lizard', this dinosaur wasn't huge by Jurassic theropod standards.Allosaurus was probably bigger, at around nine metres long. Saurophaganax - which some researchers think might have been the same dinosaur as Allosaurus - could have reached 10.5 metres in length.Megalosaurus lived during the Bathonian Age - a stretch of time midway through the Middle Jurassic Period, around 168-165 million years ago.No Megalosaurus fossils have been found in rocks from any other geological age. As far as we can tell, the dinosaur may have been extinct by the end of the Bathonian.Historically, artists have often portrayed Megalosaurus together with Iguanodon, as the two dinosaurs were among the earliest discovered. But they didn't live at the same time. Megalosaurus would have been extinct by the time Iguanodon appeared in the Early Cretaceous.We don't know for sure if Megalosaurus had feathers.Evidence of feathers has been found in a potentially related dinosaur called Sciurumimus, which may mean that Megalosaurus had some too.Some experts now think that the two dinosaurs weren't as closely related as we first thought. It's very hard to say.Megalosaurus has captured the public imagination over the years. It has featured in many unusual places.Charles Dickens mentioned the dinosaur in the very first paragraph of his 1852-1853 novel Bleak House. Dickens described a fanciful image of a gigantic, slow Megalosaurus plodding along a London street.The Victorian sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins created several huge statues of prehistoric animals, including Megalosaurus, for the Crystal Palace gardens in 1854.The Crystal Palace statues now look very outdated as they show Megalosaurus and other extinct creatures as bulky, lumbering beasts. Even so, they are important historic structures. They can still be seen in the gardens.Megalosaurus has continued to feature in various places in more recent times.In 2013, the carnivore appeared on limited edition Royal Mail stamps. Then in 2020, we collaborated with the Royal Mint and dinosaur artist Bob Nicholls to feature Megalosaurus in a special set of fifty pence coins."

    "description": "Pachycephalosaurus was an unusual-looking dinosaur. It stood on two legs, had a beak for cropping plants and had a large bony dome on its head surrounded by spikes and bumps.Some scientists think that the animal used its hard dome in head-butting contests, similar to the way modern-day rams use their horns.Other experts think that the head dome may have been used for display. Perhaps it had many uses - like the antlers of modern deer, which are used both for fighting and for display.Pachycephalosaurus lived in the Late Cretaceous Period of North America. Its fossils have been found in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Alberta.The environment was subtropical, with warm humid air and many flowering plants.Pachycephalosaurus shared its habitat with many other dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops and Ankylosaurus.Experts think Pachycephalosaurus was herbivorous, living on a diet of leaves, fruit and seeds. But nobody knows for sure.Some of the dinosaur's front teeth look a bit like those of carnivorous dinosaurs. This has led some scientists to suggest that Pachycephalosaurus might have eaten meat, too.For many years, we thought that Stygimoloch, Dracorex and Pachycephalosaurus were all separate, but possibly closely related, dinosaurs.Now, most scientists believe that Stygimoloch and Dracorex were younger forms of Pachycephalosaurus. So those dinosaur names aren't often used.An American fossil collector named Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden found the first ever Pachycephalosaurus fragment around 1860. Experts at the time thought it might be from an armadillo-like creature. They named it Tylosteus.The name Pachycephalosaurus was created in 1943 by Barnum Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer, after more fossils were discovered.It wasn't realised until the 1980s that the 'Tylosteus' fossil belonged to Pachycephalosaurus."

It was far longer, almost twice as tall and more than three times heavier than Diplodocus.Patagotitan is a titanosaur, a type of sauropod. Not all titanosaurs were particularly large, but Patagotitan was. Its thigh bone (femur) alone was 2.38 metres long.Other contenders for the title of world's largest dinosaur are Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus. But these dinosaurs are only known from very fragmentary remains. In some cases, only partial bones have been found, so the size of the rest of the bone has had to be estimated.Patagotitan is far more complete and is the one whose size scientists can be most sure of, although different methods of estimating body mass mean there is still some debate over exactly how heavy it was. The most recent estimates range from 42,500 to 71,400 kilogrammes.Patagotitan was found at La Flecha Ranch in Patagonia, Argentina, in 2010, when a ranch worker spotted an enormous dinosaur bone poking out of the ground.Scientists were brought in to investigate, and during digs in 2012, 2013 and 2015, they unearthed hundreds of fossil bones belonging to at least six dinosaurs, which died and were buried in three distinct floods.The species name mayorum honours the Mayo family, the owners of the ranch, for their hospitality during the fieldwork. Their ranch is still the only location where Patagotitan fossils have been found."

It lived towards the end of the Cretaceous Period.Very few fossils of this dinosaur have been found - only four bones belonging to a single individual. These include one neck bone, one backbone and two tail bones that were all unearthed in Argentina in 2001.Like all sauropods, Puertasaurus was a plant-eating dinosaur. The researchers who discovered its remains also found fossilised tree trunks nearby. This suggests that it may have lived in a forest habitat.The dinosaur's full name - Puertasaurus reuili - refers to two fossil hunters who discovered and worked on the remains: Pablo Puerta and Santiago Reuil.With so few Puertasaurus fossils to study, it's not possible to say once and for all how big this dinosaur would have been when it was alive.However, the existing remains are so enormous that scientists believe that Puertasaurus may have been among the very largest dinosaurs. Current estimates are that it was about 30 metres long and weighed about 50 tonnes.Many experts think it is likely that Puertasaurus would have rivalled other titanosaurs like Argentinosaurus and Patagotitan in size, but nobody can say for sure which was the largest."

    "description": "Pyroraptor was a small, meat-eating dinosaur that lived in what is now France and Spain. It got its name, which means 'fire thief', because its remains were first found after a destructive forest fire in Provence, France.This dinosaur is known from very few fossils. Only a handful of small bones and teeth have been unearthed. So full-body reconstructions of Pyroraptor are largely guesswork.Scientists think Pyroraptor was probably a dromaeosaur, and that it may have been similar to Velociraptor. But with so few fossils it's hard to tell how closely they were related.Dromaeosaurs are rare in Europe. Another, called Variraptor, was found in the same place in France as Pyroraptor. Some experts think it might be the same dinosaur. The film Jurassic World: Dominion shows Pyroraptor diving underwater to attack the main characters.It's very hard to say if any dinosaur could swim in real life, as swimming isn't usually an activity that shows in fossil evidence.Most modern animals can swim, with some exceptions such as tortoises. So most experts assume that dinosaurs - especially small- to medium-sized ones like Pyroraptor - could at least doggy paddle. But nobody knows if Pyroraptor could really dive under the surface and swim for long periods.Pyroraptor fossils were discovered in rocks from the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period. That means it must have been alive 84 to 71 million years ago.Scientists aren't sure exactly when Pyroraptor went extinct, but it probably wasn't around by the time of the meteorite impact that played a major role in wiping out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.It's very difficult to work out how large the whole dinosaur would have been because so few Pyroraptor fossils have been found.It might have been around the same size as Velociraptor, or smaller. We might get a better idea in the future if more remains are discovered. For now, we know that both dinosaurs had a similar-sized curved toe claw, measuring almost seven centimetres along the outer edge."

    "description": "Rajasaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur that lived towards the end of the Cretaceous Period in what is now India. It was a kind of abelisaur, a group that also contains the well-known dinosaur Carnotaurus.Rajasaurus sported a single short horn on the top of its head. No one knows for sure what it used this horn for, but experts think it might have been for display or for head-butting other Rajasaurus.Only parts of the skeleton of Rajasaurus have been found. But scientists have a good idea of what the whole animal may have looked like as they have more complete fossils of some of its relatives, such as Majungasaurus.Many abelisaurs had very short, stubby arms. It's likely that Rajasaurus did too, although we don't know for sure.At 6.6 metres long, Rajasaurus was one of the larger members of the abelisaurid group. But this isn't massive by Late Cretaceous theropod standards. Dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus could get much bigger.Rajasaurus was likely an ambush predator able to bring down large animals with its strong neck and jaw muscles. It may also have scavenged for food. Unfortunately, scientists know little about the types of dinosaurs Rajasaurus preyed on.Rajasaurus was discovered in the Lameta Formation, a sequence of rocks formed during the Late Cretaceous, when India was an island.Sitting on top of these rocks are many layers of basalt, a type of rock formed from lava. These layers are called the Deccan Traps. They were created by some of the largest volcanic eruptions ever.Dinosaurs in India may have gone extinct around 350,000 years before the mass extinction event that wiped out most dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period. This might have been due to volcanic eruptions."

    "description": "Spinosaurus was a large meat-eating dinosaur from Africa. Scientists think it may have lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle.Our understanding of Spinosaurus has changed in recent years. For over 100 years we only had very incomplete remains of this dinosaur. Plus, the few bones from the first discovery in 1912 were accidentally destroyed during the Second World War.For most of the last century scientists reconstructed Spinosaurus as a completely land-based animal with long hind legs, like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus.We now know that Spinosaurus had quite short legs and may have spent a lot of its time living in and around water. It also had a wide, paddle-like tail.It isn't clear whether this dinosaur swam a lot, or mostly lived on the shoreline.We know from the shape of the dinosaur's jaws that it fed on fish, although it may have eaten other dinosaurs too.Like other members of the spinosaur group, Spinosaurus had a narrow snout and a distinctive notch near the front of its jaws. This would have been very effective at trapping fish.There are several theories about the impressive 1.5-metre-high sail on Spinosaurus' back.It may have helped to regulate the animal's body temperature or been part of an elaborate mating display.The sail may even have helped to propel the dinosaur through water.Some scientists have speculated that Spinosaurus had a thick, fleshy hump rather than a thin sail. But the latest research suggests that a thin sail is most likely.Spinosaurus lived between 99 and 93.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous Period. At that time, its North African habitat consisted of tidal flats (muddy or marshy areas that get covered by the sea) and mangrove forests.The hottest time of year would bring long droughts, which would cause many lakes and rivers to dry up. This may have forced Spinosaurus to sometimes act as a land predator.At 14 metres (46 feet) long from nose to tail, Spinosaurus was longer than any other carnivorous dinosaur known to science. But we don't have any complete skeletons, so the full length is just an estimate.However, Spinosaurus' short hind legs meant that T. rex stood taller at the hips.Our understanding of how Spinosaurus walked has changed over the years.Some reconstructions of Spinosaurus show it walking on all fours, while many scientists today believe that it was able to walk on two legs. It's still not clear who is right, and we may need to wait for new discoveries or studies to find out more."

After finding a specimen that had been covered with mud, which had held the plates in place, Marsh realised that they stood vertically, alternately on either side of the spine.Scientists are not exactly sure what the plates were used for. They may have warned off predators, or allowed members of the same species to recognise each other. Another suggestion is that the plates were used to regulate body temperature.There are tiny grooves in the plate surfaces, possibly where blood vessels would have been. The amount of blood passing through these vessels would determine the amount of heat transfer.Compared with the rest of its body, Stegosaurus had a small head and its brain was around the size of a plum!The most complete Stegosaurus skeleton ever found went on display in the Museum's Earth Hall in December 2014.Identified as a member of the species Stegosaurus stenops, this spectacular specimen is helping researchers gain new insights into what Stegosaurus would have looked like when it was alive, as well as how it walked, ate and behaved."

    "description": "Tarchia was an ankylosaur, a heavily armoured type of dinosaur.Like many ankylosaurs, Tarchia sported a hard, bony club on the end of its tail. Experts have debated whether the club was used for defending against predators, for fighting other Tarchia or both.In 2021, a new Tarchia specimen was discovered with impact damage to the tail and hips. This suggests that it may have been hit by the tail club of another ankylosaur.The name Tarchia comes from the Mongolian word 'tarkhi', meaning 'brain'.Teresa Maryanska, a Polish scientist who specialised in Mongolian dinosaurs, chose this name because the dinosaur had a larger braincase than its close relative Saichania.Tarchia and Saichania - plus a third ankylosaur called Zaraapelta - all lived together in what is now the Gobi Desert. Although the Mongolian desert today is mostly rocks, in the Cretaceous Period it was a sandy expanse with dunes and oases.Tarchia's mouth shape suggests that it was probably quite selective about the types of ground-level plants it ate. Earlier ankylosaurs tended to eat many different types of plants in bulk.Tarchia also lived alongside Tarbosaurus, a meat-eating dinosaur closely related to Tyrannosaurus.Tarbosaurus tooth marks have been found on a Tarchia skull, showing that the ankylosaur was hunted by the giant predator."
